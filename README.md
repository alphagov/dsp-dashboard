# Platforms and Services dashboard

Built using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit).

This is for displaying on internal screens.

Data is a mixture of copy pasted from other team's dashboards, and sourced from JSON endpoints for Notify and Pay.

Collaborators can raise PRs and update the code to add new data.

The dashboard auto-deploys on merge on DSP's Heroku account.
