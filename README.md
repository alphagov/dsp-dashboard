# Platforms and Services dashboard

Built using the [Prototype Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit).

This is for displaying on internal screens.

This is hand maintained (MVP!) and data is copy pasted from other team's dashboards (see comments in the index.html).

Collaborators can raise PRs and update the code to add new data.

The dashboard auto-deploys on merge on @chao-xian's Railway account.
